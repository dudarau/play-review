### Code styles

[js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify)
[prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

- Prettier looks pretty nice (see what I did there?) but it doesn't have the same configurability as js-beautify.
- Prettier is opinionated and not dependant on IDE
- Prettier does not support HTML, only JSX
