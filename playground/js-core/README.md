### JS API

- [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)

Intersection information(right now has limited supportx) is needed for many reasons, such as:

    Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.
    Implementing "infinite scrolling" web sites, where more and more content is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have to flip through pages.
    Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad revenues.
    Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on whether or not the user will see the result.
