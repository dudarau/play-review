# flowchart.js 
[link](http://flowchart.js.org/) [github](https://github.com/adrai/flowchart.js)

depends on [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/)(svg library)

### Pros

- Nice tool to build flow diagram
- As svg can be inserted everywhere

### Cons

- specific syntax of diagram description
- apply custom styles is not so obvious thing 

## alternatives

[js-sequence-diagrams](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/) - the same but for sequence diagrams. It has almost the same pros and cons.
