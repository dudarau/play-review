### clients
There are two major GraphQL clients available at the moment. The first one is [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), which is a community-driven effort to build a powerful and flexible GraphQL client for all major development platforms. The second one is called [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) and it is Facebookâ€™s homegrown GraphQL client that heavily optimizes for performance and is only available on the web.
