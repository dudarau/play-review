### clients
There are two major GraphQL clients available at the moment. The first one is [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), which is a community-driven effort to build a powerful and flexible GraphQL client for all major development platforms. The second one is called [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) and it is Facebookâ€™s homegrown GraphQL client that heavily optimizes for performance and is only available on the web.

- [Unit-tests for React+Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/guides/testing-react-components.html)

[Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) is pretty complex framework if we compare to Apollo.

### utilities
- [dataloader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader) DataLoader is a generic utility to be used as part of your application's data fetching layer to provide a consistent API over various backends and reduce requests to those backends via batching and caching.
